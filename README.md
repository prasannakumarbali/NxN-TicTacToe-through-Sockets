A mini project on client server architecture that lets you to play a Dynamic TicTacToe flawlessly



## Introduction
The-NXN-TicTacToe-through-sockets-in-C is a command-line based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using sockets in the C programming language. The game allows two players to connect to a server using sockets and play Tic Tac Toe on an N x N grid. This README file provides an overview of the project, instructions for compiling and running the code, and other relevant information. To Know more about the project refer the "ProjectReport" pdf

## Multi-Threading
The code utilizes multithreading to handle multiple clients concurrently. Each client connection is handled in a separate thread, allowing two players to play the game simultaneously.

## Prerequisites
To compile and run the code, you need to have the following prerequisites installed on your Linux system:

GCC (GNU Compiler Collection): A C compiler.

Sockets library: The code requires the standard sockets library available on Linux.
